# Project-on-Surveillance-for-Medical-Assistance-in-Campus
The proposed model uses video surveillance and CNN algorithms to monitor students and detect abnormal activities like fainting. By analyzing student movements through labeled image datasets, the system classifies actions in real-time. Upon detecting unusual incidents, it sends immediate alerts to the campus healthcare center for quick intervention.
